# eqCurveCSVGenerator
A project to generate csv files of different equalization curves, which will be a data source for a later project that will do equalization on audio, most likely in real time.
Current equalization curves are the standard RIAA playback curve and the IEC RIAA playback curve. 
Potentially will add playback curves relating to reel to reel tape playback (NAB and CCIR), as well as other playback curves for records prior to the RIAA curve standardization.
